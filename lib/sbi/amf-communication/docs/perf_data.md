**max_traffic_rate** | **char \*** | String representing a bit rate; the prefixes follow the standard symbols from The International System of Units, and represent x1000 multipliers, with the exception that prefix \&quot;K\&quot; is used to represent the standard symbol \&quot;k\&quot;.  | [optional] 
**min_traffic_rate** | **char \*** | String representing a bit rate; the prefixes follow the standard symbols from The International System of Units, and represent x1000 multipliers, with the exception that prefix \&quot;K\&quot; is used to represent the standard symbol \&quot;k\&quot;.  | [optional] 
**agg_traffic_rate** | **char \*** | String representing a bit rate; the prefixes follow the standard symbols from The International System of Units, and represent x1000 multipliers, with the exception that prefix \&quot;K\&quot; is used to represent the standard symbol \&quot;k\&quot;.  | [optional]
