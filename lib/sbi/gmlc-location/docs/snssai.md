## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**sst** | **int** | Unsigned integer, within the range 0 to 255, representing the Slice/Service Type.  It indicates the expected Network Slice behaviour in terms of features and services. Values 0 to 127 correspond to the standardized SST range. Values 128 to 255 correspond  to the Operator-specific range. See clause 28.4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003. Standardized values are defined in clause 5.15.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501.   | 
**sd** | **char \*** | 3-octet string, representing the Slice Differentiator, in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the string shall take a value of \&quot;0\&quot; to \&quot;9\&quot;, \&quot;a\&quot; to \&quot;f\&quot; or \&quot;A\&quot; to \&quot;F\&quot; and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits of the SD shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the SD shall appear last in the string. This is an optional parameter that complements the Slice/Service type(s) to allow to  differentiate amongst multiple Network Slices of the same Slice/Service type. This IE shall be absent if no SD value is associated with the SST.  | [optional]
