# 5G NR Positioning and Future Extensions (Rebuild)

This project rebuilds and extends an open 5G NR positioning simulation, focused on NRPPa over NGAP communication, and incorporates future development concepts for robust wireless localization.

We reconstruct and modernize the project for easier extensibility, research-grade experiments, and integration with real-world datasets.

## üì° Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide a modular and ready-to-use simulation platform for:
- 5G NR-PPa positioning signaling over NGAP
- Uplink TDoA-based localization using OpenAirInterface-style networks
- Scenario testing for indoor and urban environments (LOS/NLOS)
- Integration of real-world datasets for validation

It enables simulation and research on:
- Multi-base station (gNB) based positioning
- NRPPa protocol messaging between NG-RAN, AMF, and LMF
- Handling multipath, interference, and non-line-of-sight challenges

## üìÇ Dataset and Credits

This project uses real 5G positioning data from [Zenodo Record #15261338](https://zenodo.org/records/15261338), originally created by **Nico Kalis**.
The dataset has been organized under the `/datasets` directory for easy access.
